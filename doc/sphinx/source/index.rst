   contain the root `toctree` directive.

The Light Utility Library (libLU)
=================================

This is a C library of utility functions and data structures.  It is
"light" because it aims to have a low impact on the rest of your code:
using one utility does not force you to use the rest; data structures
are as transparent as possible; etc.

Each header file is documented below.  They are ordered with the most
basic functionality first.
